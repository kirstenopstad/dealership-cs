# Dealership

#### By Kirsten Opstad & Richard Cha

#### A web app for a fictional car dealership

## Technologies Used

* C#
* .Net 6
* MSTest
* ASP.NET Core 6 MVC

## Description

### Objectives (MVP)

Create a car dealership application that allows users to add new cars through a nicely-formatted web interface.

* Make sure the Car class is well-tested. Try including both public properties and a private field.
  - Make, Model, Year

* Think carefully about how to use a static property to track all cars that have been created. (In the To Do List example, we added Items to a list using the keyword this. For this exercise, we are dealing with Cars instead. How should we declare _instances in this case? What kind of data type should we use?
